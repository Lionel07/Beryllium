And only the kernel.\r\n\r\nThis kernel is unique in the fact that it is a macrokernel that is transitioning into a microkernel. Well, I say unique, more like \"special snowflake\".\r\n\r\nUnique Features\r\n---------\r\n* IO Interrupt Messaging System\r\n\r\nBranches ([top](#btop))\r\n---------\r\n+ master: Stable production safe code is stored here.\r\n+ dev: The latest and most up to date code is stored here. May not be working or stable\r\n+ arm: ARM code and features are put here and tested, before being merged into dev.\r\n+ staging: (Sometimes) holds code that is being prepared for merging into master.\r\n+ *: Feature branches, implementing different features. They get merged into dev and deleted.\r\n\r\nThe release process generally is:\r\n\r\nfeature-branch -> dev/arm -> staging -> master (release)\r\n\r\nThis kernel's source has organisation. To understand this organisation to effectively navigate the code, please look at src/README.md\r\n\r\nBuilding ([top](#btop))\r\n---------\r\n* Prerequisites: clang, make, nasm\r\n* Obtain the source code (conviently, you can get the latest code with git clone \"https://github.com/Lionel07/Beryllium.git\"!)\r\n\r\nNow, Beryllium comes with it's own cross compiler (well, binutils, but you can also build clang too), which resides in the toolkit directory.\r\nThis is local to beryllium, so it won't mess with the users setup. There are two options, makebinutils.sh or makebinutils-pi.sh. \r\nDon't worry about the other files, they are there for legacy reasons.\r\nUse makebinutils.sh if you are just trying to the compile the kernel for x86, or makebinutils-pi.sh for building for Raspberry Pi (arm).\r\n\r\n* Run the appropriate makebinutils.sh . It does not require root privilages (and keeps to the toolkit directory). It automates the building of binutils for you. Might take a couple of minutes.\r\n```\r\n$ cd Beryllium/tools\r\n$ ./makebinutils.sh\r\n$ cd ../\r\n$ make clean all\r\n```\r\n* Run the kernel in qemu with `make run`!\r\n\r\nKernel Options ([top](#btop))\r\n---------\r\nIn the makefile, there is a section labeled \"COMPILE_OPTIONS :=\". This section is for inputting switches that can change some parts of what is compiled or not.\r\n\r\nAn example is the defaults: `-D DEBUG -D ENABLE_SERIAL`\r\n\r\nDEBUG enables debug features, while ENABLE_SERIAL, well, enables serial. Each must be prefixed with `-D`, because these options are passed raw into `${CC}`\r\n\r\nIn progress...\r\nWill be on the wiki soon!\r\n###Speaking of wiki's?
